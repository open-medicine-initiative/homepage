Medical data is sensitive personal data. But it is also valuable data to share with others. It is therefore important to find a good compromise between data privacy and openness.

Network communication always uses secured connections (https) and will work with common anonymizers like Tor.

openMediAid stores medical data without any references to personal identity - each medical profile is anonymously owned by a user whose actual identity is not known to the system. However, reconstruction of identity is theoretically possible provided that a sufficiently detailed profile is matched with another datasource in which records reference real people. Therefore, openMediAid gives its users full control over the amount of information displayed to the public, trusted users or data exports.

Internally, all information will be used

* to build support groups

* in cluster analysis

* group specific statistics
