> **Improve medical decision making**

Medical decision making is about choosing the best options from a set of possible alternatives:  
a. the choice of tests and examinations in the process of differential diagnosis,    
b. deciding on a diagnosis from a set of candidates (different diseases may present themselves in very similar ways),  
c. choosing of treatment
 
Reality shows that even common medical conditions may take long time before a working diagnosis can be found. Even if a diagnosis has been found, patients often do not receive all relevant information about their condition and available treatments which may lead to complications and sub-optimal outcomes in their recovery process.

However, with billions of people around, almost any medical problem has most likely been addressed by someone. The problem is that the resulting knowledge is not easily accessible to others: they are unaware of the solutions that other people with similar conditions have already found. Obviously, people can make **significant progress simply by following the advice and ideas of others** who have already walked a bit of the path. The success stories of word-of-mouth recommendations show that even individual experiences can help guide others. Moreover, each reported medical case contributes to the empirical evidence which allows medical decisions to be taken even more accurately. Clearly, there is a need to systematise the collection, classification and sharing of individual cases.

Many patients experience a sense of powerlessness when the health care system fails to include them in diagnostic or treatment processes. They often receive little information about treatment options or the underlying causes of their symptoms. This passive and dependent role is counterproductive and is considered to have a negative effect on the process of recovery. Patients should instead be treated as vital agents in the entire process.

Information is a key factor in empowering people to self-help. 

Medical information in the internet is mostly of average or poor quality. It is often incomplete or opinionated and rarely references empirical data. User forums are a frequent source of information but discussions are many times emotional or off topic. Medical information is mixed with personal opinions and it is very difficult to verify the validity of specific claims.

openMediAid aims to improve this situation with structured data models, expert reviews, community moderators and by providing as much statistical data as possible.

> **Focus on what helps**

Many areas of public health care are influenced by financial interests of the pharmaceutical / medical industry. Potential for profit may determine which medical areas are primarily researched. This in turn defines which kinds of treatment are backed-up with empirical data, recommended by doctors and covered by health care providers.

openMediAid, in contrast, has no other interest than helping people get better and as such includes and promotes methods that have shown to be working. It embraces the creativity that people have when looking for solutions to their problems.
